         This file contains last-minute information about NZ-COM.


----------  NZ-COM RELEASE 1.2d    January 20, 1989

NZCOM.COM  version 1.2d fixes yet another minor bug by forcing a warm  boot 
whenever a new DOS module is loaded by itself.  The progress report is also 
a little less verbose unless declaring the /T(est) option.  If the /Q(uiet) 
option is declared, NZCOM is now completely silent.

New versions of SAVE.COM, ERA.COM, REN.COM, P.COM, POKE.COM and their  Type 
3 counterparts are included in this release.  

NZSUB version 1.0 is released.  Unlike SUB.COM, NZSUB is not ZCPR3 specific 
and  runs  as  well  under CP/M.  Its batch  files  can  be  formatted  and 
commented much like those of ZEX4.  See NZSUB.SUB for an example.  

TCSELECT version 1.2 can now be run successfully under CP/M.


----------  NZ-COM RELEASE 1.2     November 1, 1988

NZCOM.COM version 1.2 includes two changes of significance.  First, due  to 
an  oversight, when version 1.0 was told to load a new ZCM or ENV file  for 
which no new modules had to be loaded, it also failed to update data in the 
environment, such as printer characteristics, maximum drives and users, and 
so on.  It will now do so.

The second change was in the safety checking performed by NZCOM.COM to make 
sure that it was being requested to load a version that was consistent with 
the  underlying  CP/M system.  This check turned out to  be  stricter  than 
necessary  and  was preventing NZ-COM from running on some  systems  (e.g., 
Lobo Max) that, in fact, could support it quite nicely.


----------  NEW FILES: NZCPR.LBR, NZFCP.LBR, NZRCP.LBR

The  main  NZCOM.LBR now contains only the standard configurations  of  the 
CPR, FCP, and RCP modules to minimize disk space requirements.  Alternative 
versions of these modules are now supplied in separate libraries.   Modules 
can  be  loaded directly from these libraries, or individual files  can  be 
extracted  and  put  into NZCOM.LBR to replace  the  default  files.   Each 
library  has a brief DOC file describing the modules (one of which  is  the 
default version included in NZCOM.LBR).


----------  NEW PROGRAM:  ZEX TYPE 4

Named  ZEX4.COM  in this release, this is a new version of  ZEX  with  many 
features not seen before (See ZEX4.DOC).  This program is brand new and may 
well exhibit one or two un-planned 'features'.  Please report any problems.


----------  EASE PROBLEMS

There  are  unfortunately serious defects in the coding of EASE.   On  many 
computers  EASE  appears  to  work without problems,  on  some  it  crashes 
completely,  and  on others it works but causes other strange  behavior  to 
occur.  We tried using it on a Kaypro with the K-ROM (?), and as soon as we 
loaded ease we started to get BIOS errors on disk reads.  We hope that  the 
author of EASE (or someone else) will discover and correct these  problems. 
The program is so nice conceptually.  Use it with caution.


----------  VLU VERSIONS

We  forgot  when writing the manual that VLU, like ZFILER,  has  two  quite 
different  versions depending on whether your terminal uses reverse or  dim 
video for highlighting.  Therefore, you will find on the release disk  VLU-
REV.COM  and  VLU-DIM.COM.  Copy the appropriate one to your  working  disk 
under the name VLU.COM.
