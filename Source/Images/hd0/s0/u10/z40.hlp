   This Command Processor is a direct outgrowth of ZCPR 3.4 and many
popular Resident Command Processor (RCP) extensions.  It takes advantage
of the Command Line Parser in ZSDOS2 and the Banking capabilities of B/P
Bios, if available, to reduce the resident portion of the Processor.
Commands built into Z40 include:

  CLS       COPY      DATE      DIR       ECHO      ERASE     FEED
  FREE      GET       GO        HELP      JUMP      LIST      NOTE
  PEEK      POKE      PORT      PROTECT   REGISTER  RENAME    RESET
  SAVE      SPOP      TIME      TYPE      VER       WHL
