:
	 {JUMP}  - Execute code at a Specified Address

   This command permits execution of code at any specified address
in the range of 0 to FFFFH in the current TPA memory area.  The user
must insure that the the target address contains a valid program.

Syntax:		JUMP Hexaddress

:
	 {PEEK}  - Examine memory contents

   This command permits the user to examine memory contents
throughout the Memory Range in A B/P Bios configuration.

Syntax:		P [Bnk#:]StartAdr [EndAdr]

	Where:	Bnk# = B/P Memory Bank in decimal.  The TPA bank
			or PEEK values since the last Warm Boot
			are assumed if not specified.
		StartAdr, EndAdr = Hex Addresses

NOTE: For long displays, the screen may be paused with the Ctrl-S
  toggle.  To abort a long display, follow a Ctrl-S with a Ctrl-C.

:
	 {POKE}  - Alter memory contents

   This command permits the user to alter the contents of TPA memory.
Altering other banks is not permitted to assure the integrity of the
Operating System.

Syntax:		POKE addr [nn][..nn]
			or
		POKE addr "a[..a]

	Where:	addr = Hexidecimal address to start the entry
		nn = Hexidecimal value(s) to enter
		a = Ascii character(s) to enter

NOTE: The Ascii toggle may be used after preliminary Hex digit entry
  but is Not reversible.  i.e. all following characters are entered
  as literal Ascii.

:
	 {PORT}  - Examine contents of Input Port

   This command permits the user to examine the contents of Input
Registers within the range 0..FFFFH.  The command properly handles
the on-board IO ports in the HD64180/Z180, and extended IO addresses.

Syntax:		PORT nn

	Where:	nn = Hexidecimal Port Address in [0..FFFF]
