:
	 {RESET}  - Re-log the Hard & Floppy Drive System

   This command Re-logs all Hard and Floppy Drives on the system.
It properly handles the Fast-Relog feature of ZSDOS and re-logs the
default disk when complete.  This should be executed after any
Unerase or PUTDS operation on Hard Drives to insure that the Banked
Allocation Vector in ZSDOS2 is properly updated.

Syntax:		RES

:
	 WHL  - Read/Set the Wheel Byte

   This command simply reads the Wheel byte and indicates the
current setting if no arguments are passed.  If arguments exist,
they are compared to the embedded Password in the CPR.  If a match
is obtained, the Wheel Byte is turned On giving the user appropriate
privileges.  A mismatch Disables the Wheel byte restricting the user.

Syntax:		WHL		<- Display current setting
		WHL password	<- Turn on if match, else disable
