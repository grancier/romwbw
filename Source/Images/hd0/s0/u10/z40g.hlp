:
	 TIME  - Print/{Set} Current System Time

   This command, if no arguments are specified, will simply display
the current Hours, Minutes, and Seconds reported by the Dos.  In a
fully-implemented system, this will be the B/P Bios Real Time Clock.
If arguments are passed, the current setting of the Wheel byte is
checked.  If the Wheel Byte is OFF, the time is simply displayed,
otherwise the arguments will be interpreted at a new time to set and
parsed accordingly.  If no errors are detected, the system time will
be updated and the revised setting displayed.  Arguments are parsed
in the order; Hours, Minutes, Seconds.  All fields do not have to be
present.  Current setting of fields not entered are retained if not
explicitly altered.

Syntax:		TIME
		TIME hh[:mm][:ss]

:
	 DATE  - Print/{Set} Current System Date

   This command, if no arguments are specified, will simply display
the current Day, Month, and Year as reported by the Dos.  An assembly
option selects US (mmm dd, yyyy) or European (dd mmm yyyy) form.  In a
fully-implemented system, this will be the B/P Bios Real Time Clock.
If arguments are passed, the current setting of the Wheel byte is
checked.  If the Wheel Byte is OFF, the date is simply displayed,
otherwise the arguments will be interpreted at a new date to set and
parsed accordingly.  If no errors are detected, the system date will
be updated and the revised setting displayed.  Arguments may be parsed
either mm/dd/yy sequence if the "slash" character delimits the fields,
or dd-mm-yy sequence if any other character (normally dash or period)
delimits the fields.  All fields do not have to be present, although
at least one is required to determine the parse order.  The current
setting of fields not entered are retained unless explicitly altered.

Syntax:		DATE
		DATE mm/dd/yy
		DATE dd.mm.yy   or   dd-mm-yy

:
	 VER  - Display Operating System Version Numbers

   This command displays CPR, DOS and BIOS Version Numbers for the
system currently executing.  It assumes ZSDOS and B/P Bios and uses
the unique features of those systems to obtain the relevant values.
