1.  Introduction.

     ZDE, the Z-System Display Editor, is a small, fast, powerful 
text editor based Eric Meyer's famous Video Display Editor (VDE).  
ZDE retains all features of VDE, but removes defects and supports 
special ZCPR and ZSDOS features such as named directories, 
register variables, automatic disk relog, and file datestamp 
support.  The install program has also been improved (see 
ZDE10.NEW for a complete rundown of improvements).  At the same 
time, I have tried to be conscientious about the balance between 
features and memory usage.  If I added every new feature or 
convenience that came to mind, we would soon have a luxurious 
in-memory editor for 2 kilobyte files!  Much of the following is 
adapted with permission from Eric Meyer's VDE.DOC.

     ZDE's native ASCII mode and definable macros make it an ideal 
programmer's editor; its full formatting and printing features 
also make it an efficient word processor.  Written entirely in Z80 
assembler, ZDE is F-A-S-T.  There are no disk overlays, and all 
editing is done in memory.  As a result, finding a string near the 
end of a 50K file takes WordStar 3.3 about 14 seconds (8MHz Z80); 
ZDE does it in under a second.  This is like moving through air 
instead of molasses: you will find that you can do more of your 
work on screen, and less on paper.

Among ZDE's features are:

Full-screen editing       User area and named directory support
Block operations          Wordwrap and reformat
File datestamp support    Macro programs
Disk file operations      Margins, tabs, spacing
Find and replace          WordStar compatibility
Many print features       Undeletion
Configurable options      Support for all CP/M terminals


2.  Installing ZDE.

     ZDE works with Z80 CP/M 2.2 and 3.0 and compatible systems.  
It is ideal for portable computers with limited disk space.  There 
are many user configurable options, and ZDE can be installed for 
all CP/M terminals.  If you are running ZCPR, ZSDOS or Z3PLUS, ZDE 
offers features not available with less advanced system software, 
but these system enhancements are not required.

     To install ZDE, use the ZDENSTAL configuration program; see 
the accompanying file ZDENSTAL.DOC.  You should install ZDE for 
your computer's terminal at the earliest convenience, since this 
greatly enhances performance.  There are many other installable 
options; you will discover how you want everything set in the 
course of using ZDE, so don't worry about going through all of it 
at first.  For ease of reference, portions of this manual 
referring to installable options and settings are enclosed in 
square brackets ("[" and "]").


3.  Invoking ZDE.

     ZDE is invoked from your system's command prompt using the 
following syntax ("ufn" means "unambiguous file name"):

     ZDE                 Begin working on a new file.

     ZDE ufn             Edit a new or already existing file.

     ZDE dir:ufn         Edit a new or existing file from another 
                          directory.

     ZDE ufn m           Edit a file using mode "m."
     ZDE ufn[m

"m" above can be either W, A, or N (see File Modes, below), and 
"dir" can be either a drive, a user area, a drive followed by a 
user area, or a ZCPR named directory.  For example:

     ZDE A4:MYFILE.TXT N      Begin working on MYFILE.TXT at user 
                               area 4, drive A, in non-document 
                               mode.

     The size of the file to be edited is limited by available 
memory.  This will vary for different systems, but normally the 
maximum size will be between 45 and 55k.  If a file is too large 
to edit, you must break it up and edit the pieces separately.  
Numerous CP/M utilities are available which will break up and 
rejoin ASCII files.


4.  ZDE's Command Set.

     ZDE's commands consist of simple one- or two-key 
combinations, easily found by the touch typist without 
distraction.  Most commands are the same as WordStar's.  If you 
have questions that this file can't answer, a WordStar manual may 
be a useful reference.  But ZDE is not a WordStar "clone"; there 
are significant differences, including an extended set of 
ESC-commands for functions such as macros (see below).
     Virtually complete compatibility with the WordStar command 
(sub)set can be achieved UNLESS the keys ^J, ^K, and ^L are used 
as arrow keys (as on many CP/M computers).  In this event ZDE 
synonyms must be used: ESC- for the ^K- prefix; ESC-H for ^J; and 
^\ for ^L (see ZDENSTAL.DOC for terminal installation).

4.1.  Command Summary.

     Below, the "^" character indicates use of the Ctrl key:  ^K = 
Ctrl+K.  The ESC (^K), ^O, and ^Q prefixes require pressing two 
keys in sequence: ^O C, for instance means press ^O, then C (or 
^C).  Any prefix may be canceled by typing ESC or Space.

4.1.1.  Control Keys:  Single Keystroke Commands.

     CR = Carriage return (^M).  Marks a paragraph end.
     BS = Backspace (^H).
    TAB = Hard Tab mode: insert tab (^I).  Variable Tab mode: move 
          to next stop.

     Arrow keys:  WordStar: ^E up, ^X down, ^S left, ^D right.
                  Alternate: configurable, default ^K, ^J, ^H, ^L.

     ^O Arrow:  Up (including ^E) = make current line top of 
                                    screen.

     ^O R = set right margin (column 1 turns off 
            wordwrap/formatting).
     ^O L = set left margin.
     ^O X = toggle Margin Release on/off.
     ^O C = center current line.

5.  Command Descriptions.

5.1.  Auto-Indent Mode (^O-A).

     Auto-Indent is useful for typing outlines, structured program 
source code, and other text where the "left margin" varies.  
Auto-Indent causes the RETURN key to act differently: If you are 
entering new text, it will be indented to match the previous line. 
If you are just moving through the file, the cursor advances past 
any existing indentation.

5.2.  Block Commands (^K-B, -K, -U, -R, -Y, -W, -C, -V, -P-B, 
      ^Q-B).

     A "block" of text is normally delimited by two markers 
[default: ^@] which remain in memory until reset or deleted.
     ^K-B marks the beginning of the block; ^K-K marks its end.
Markers are inserted in the text.  The two markers are identical;
the first one present is the start.
     ^K-U unmarks the block, removing any marker(s) set (block 
markers can also be deleted individually as ordinary characters).  
Markers are automatically removed as appropriate when ^K-B/-K are 
used again.
     ^K-R reads in the contents of a disk file, inserting it as a 
block after the current cursor position.  You will be asked for 
the name (and, optionally, mode) of the file.  Other block 
operation commands all require a Block to be marked:
     ^K-Y deletes the block (including markers).
     ^K-W writes the block text to a disk file; you will be asked 
for the filename (and optional mode).
     ^K-V moves the Block text to the present cursor location, 
deleting the original; ^K-C copies it and leaves the original.  
Sometimes ZDE will run out of memory when moving blocks within a 
large file.  If this occurs, just write the block to a file, 
delete it, and read it back in as: "^K-W, ^K-Y, ^K-R".
    ^K-P-B (^K-P with B option) prints the block text only.
     The ^Q-B command, from wherever you are in the file, moves 
the cursor to the Block start.

5.3.  Cursor Movement (Arrow keys; ^F; ^A; ^Q-R, -C, -I).

     ZDE supports three sets of Arrow keys, which function 
interchangeably.  The two built-in sets support the WordStar 
"arrow key diamond" ^E, ^X, ^D, ^S, and the ANSI standard 3-byte 
sequences (ESC-[-A, etc.).  The third set is user-configurable, 
and must be installed with ZDENSTAL.  These keys move the cursor 
up, down, right, and left respectively.  Note: if you install ^J, 
^K, and ^L as arrow keys, you must use ESC- commands for help, 
file operations, and repeat find/replace, respectively.
     Preceded by ^Q-, any arrow key (except ANSI) moves more 
quickly: to the top or bottom of the screen, to the left or right 
end of the line.
     There are also two word movement commands: ^F moves right, to 
the start of the next word; ^A moves left, to the start of the 
previous (or current) word.  Both have maximum ranges of 255 
characters.
     For quickly covering large distances, the commands ^Q-R and 
^Q-C go all the way to the beginning and end of the file, 
respectively, and ^Q-I goes to any specified page (or line, in 
non-documents).

5.4.  Deleting (^G, DEL, ^T, ^Y, ^Q-Y, -DEL, -T).

     You can delete text one CHARACTER at a time: ^G deletes to 
the right of the cursor, and DEL to the left.  [If you have no DEL 
key, you can install another equivalent.]  Note that the ordinary 
BS (^H) does not normally delete.
     ^T deletes an entire WORD to the right (up to 255 characters)
     ^Y deletes the entire current LINE.  ^Q-Y deletes only the 
part of the line to the right of the cursor; ^Q-DEL deletes the 
part to the left.
     ^Q-T deletes UP TO a specified character.  Example: "^Q-T." 
deletes to the end of the sentence.  Special case: "^Q-T-CR" 
deletes to the next HARD CR, the end of the paragraph.  This is a 
powerful command, so use it with caution.
     Accidentally deleted text can usually be recovered (see 
Undelete, below).

5.5.  Disk Operations (^K-F, -E).

     ^K-F gives an unsorted list of disk FILES: hit CR to list the 
directory specified by the current file, or specify a drive, user, 
or named directory (colon optional).  If there is not enough room 
to fit all the files on the screen, you will see "..." at the end 
to indicate that there were still more.  Press ESC or Space to 
continue.
     ^K-E will ERASE a single disk file to provide more room on 
the disk (no wildcards allowed).

5.6.  File Commands (^K-N, -S, -X, -Q, -D, -L).

     ^K-N NAMES your work or changes the current file mode.  You 
can change the filename in the header before saving, and/or change 
its mode to WordStar, ASCII, or Nondocument.  To set the file 
mode, introduce the mode character with the left square bracket, 
e.g., "Name: MYFILE.WS [W".
     ^K-S SAVES your work: what's in memory is written to disk 
under the file name in the header (you must have a file name; one 
will be requested if necessary).  If that file already existed, a 
backup (.BAK) file may be preserved [configurable; see 
installation guide].  If you haven't changed the file, ZDE prompts 
you to confirm that you want to resave it anyway.
     There are several different commands for finishing up:
     ^K-X saves your work and then EXITS to CP/M.
     ^K-Q just QUITS.  If the file has been modified, ZDE asks if 
you want to abandon the changes.
     ^K-D (DONE) saves your work, then loads a new file to edit.
     ^K-L quits the current file and LOADS a new one to begin 
editing.

5.7.  Find, Replace (^Q-F, -A, ^L, ^\).

      ^Q-F is the command to FIND a string.  The search normally 
proceeds from the cursor position forward, and is case 
(upper/lower) insensitive.  There are two options: "B" = search 
backwards;  "C" = case sensitive search.  If used, the options 
must be enclosed in slashes (eg, "/bc/") before the search string. 
(If you want to search for a string beginning with a slash, use an 
empty (//) option first.)  In addition, a ^P-Z [this can be 
reconfigured] functions as a wildcard matching any single 
character.  Other control codes, like ^M for newline, can be 
included (with the ^P prefix where needed).  Examples:

     Find: /c/^MLABEL    matches "LABEL" at start of line only;
     Find: 4^Z^Z01       matches "42201", "47401", etc;
     Find: wordstar      matches "WORDSTAR", "WordStar" etc;
     Find: ///88         matches "/88";
     Find: /b/esc        looks backwards for "Esc", "esc", etc.

     ^Q-A is the FIND/REPLACE command.  It asks for a string to 
find, and what to change it to (all options above apply to the 
search string only).  The cursor will be placed on each occurrence 
of the string successively, starting at the cursor location.  You 
will see the prompt "Chg?" in the header.  To replace the old 
string with the new one, press "Y"; anything else skips to the 
next.  To change all further occurrences without being asked, 
press "*".  ESC cancels at any time.  (Note: if ^Q-A is used in a 
Macro, it will automatically assume "*" with no further input 
required.)
     ^L (or ^\, if ^L is an arrow key) repeats the last ^Q-F or 
^Q-A command.  For ^Q-A, you will be asked whether you want to 
replace the found string.  For both, direction and case options 
remain unchanged.

5.8.  Header (^O-Q).

     ZDE normally gives you a header, or status line, at the top 
of the screen.  However, if you like you can toggle the header 
display on and off with the ^O-Q (QUIET) command.  [The header may 
also be suppressed by default.]  This lets you see more file text. 
It can also speed up operation on some slower terminals, as the 
position doesn't have to be continually updated.

     A typical header line looks something like:
------------------------------------------------------------------
B0/WORK:ZDE.DOC [A Pg 8    Ln 31   Cl 53   INS vt hy AI DS MR  ^Q_
------------------------------------------------------------------
     "B0/WORK:ZDE.DOC [A" = Current directory, filename, and mode.
     "Pg 8, etc" = Current position in file by page, line, column. 
For "N"ondocuments, there is no page number display.  If 
pagination (^O-P) is off, you will see "Pg 0" (document) or "OP" 
(nondocument) here.
     "INS" = Insert mode on (^V).
     "vt" = Variable tabs on (^O-V).
     "hy" = Hyphenation enabled. (^O-H)  Doesn't display in "N" 
            mode.
     "AI" = Auto indent mode on (^O-A).
     "DS" = Double spacing (^O-S).
     "MR" = Margins released (^O-X).  Doesn't display in "N" mode.
     "^Q_": Prefix keys (and some prompts) display here.

5.9.  Information (^K-I).

     ^KI displays an Information message with:

     - the ZDE version and date;
     - whether (Y/N) the file has been changed since last saved;
     - the current size of the file in bytes;
     - the number of bytes of text memory used and free (1024 
       bytes = 1K).

     You will note that the file uses about 20-25% less memory 
than its actual length; this is due to ZDE's compression of text.  
(Note: ZDE is limited to 16-bit arithmetic.  In the unlikely event 
that file size should exceed 64K it will be shown mod 64K; just 
add 65536.)
     Block moves and copying are limited by the amount of free 
memory.  Further, when there is less than 1K free, response time 
can get very slow.

5.10.  Insert Mode (^V).

     ^V toggles insertion on and off.  If insert is OFF, any text 
to the right of the cursor is overwritten as you type.  If insert 
is ON, what you type is inserted, and existing text moves to the 
right.

5.11.  Line Spacing (^O-S).

     The ^O-S command toggles between single and double line 
spacing.  In double space mode, the following functions generate 
double carriage returns:  CR (^M), Insert CR (^N), Reform (^B), 
Wordwrap.  You can easily mix single and double spacing; the ^B 
command can convert between the two.  Note: if you prefer to keep 
your actual file single spaced, you can still get a double-spaced 
printout by using the "D" option of the ^K-P command (see 
Printing).

5.12.  Margins (^O-R, -L, -X, -C, -F).

     ^O-R sets the RIGHT margin, enabling wordwrap, reformatting, 
and centering.  A right margin of 1 disables all formatting 
functions (same as in "N"ondocument mode).  At the prompt 
"Column:" enter the column number (1-255), or just hit CR for the 
current cursor column.  If the value entered conflicts with the 
current left margin, ZDE sets the left margin to 1.
     ^O-L sets the LEFT margin in an identical fashion; of course, 
the value must always be less than the current right margin, 
meaning it's best to set the right margin first.
     ^O-X temporarily RELEASES the margins (resets them to 1), 
allowing you to type outside them.  Use ^O-X again to restore the 
margins.
     ^O-C CENTERS the current line with respect to the margins, if 
set.  ^O-F sets the current line FLUSH right, if the right margin 
is set.

5.13.  Pagination (^O-P).

     The ^O-P command sets the page length.  Enter a value from 0 
to 255, or just hit CR to restore the default value [normally 54].
     When the value is nonzero, it determines the page and line 
shown in the document header ("Pg xx Ln xx"), and page-oriented 
Print functions (formfeeds, headers, start/stop print) are enabled.
     When the value is zero, pagination is off.  The header will 
say "Pg 0 Ln xxxx", showing you the absolute line number in the 
file.  Also, printing occurs with no page breaks or formfeeds.  
This can be useful for printing small things right after each 
other on the same sheet; or, in conjunction with the "*" print 
option, can be used to print out multiple copies of index cards, 
labels, etc.
     ZDE never sends a formfeed before printing; begin your file 
with a ^P-L character if you need one.  Otherwise, use of ^P-L is 
not recommended in document files as it renders ZDE's page count 
inaccurate.

5.14.  Place Markers and Line Queue (^P-Z, ^Q-Z, ^Q-Q).

     You can set any number of temporary PLACE MARKERS in the text 
with ^P-Z (they will appear as ^Z).  The ^Q-Z command moves the 
cursor to the next place marker in the file, cycling back to the 
top of the file if needed.  Place markers are NOT saved to disk.
     ZCPR users may also store a QUEUE of up to eight line numbers 
in their user-defined messages (a set of sixteen bytes of 
protected memory "available for user definition").  The ^Q-Q 
command will then cycle through the queue of line numbers, 
returning to the first location when it reaches a value of zero.  
A value greater than the number of lines in the file takes the 
cursor to the end of the file.  The numbers are stored as two-byte 
inverted hexadecimal words.  This facility is intended as an 
interface between other programs and ZDE for such purposes as 
storing the locations of compiler errors, however ZCPR users may 
also find it useful to POKE these locations directly before 
invoking ZDE.

5.15.  Printer Codes (^P).

     Control codes for special effects in printing can be entered 
in the text with the ^P prefix.  Thus pressing ^P-^H (or ^P-H) 
embeds a ^H, etc.  Several standard codes are:

     ^H - backspace - overstrike previous character
     ^I - hard (ASCII) tab - printers respond variously to this
     ^L - formfeed  (Not recommended unless pagination (^O-P) 
          disabled)

     The Block marker, normally ^@, cannot be embedded, and ^Z is 
reserved for use as a place marker.  Control codes display on 
screen as capital letters, highlighted if possible.  ZDE assumes 
they are not characters, so they are not counted when reformatting 
text.
     For greater convenience, you can also arrange to have a 
single ^P-code produce an entire string of bytes for commonly used 
printing effects.  ZDE supports a subset of WordStar's printer 
installation, seven definable codes: four toggles, four switches.  
The Printer Installation in ZDENSTAL allows you to choose what 
codes you want to use, and install the actual control sequences 
your printer needs.  The defaults are:

     toggles:  ^B, ^D, ^S, ^Y
     switches: ^Q, ^W, ^E, ^R

     In WordStar these toggles are Boldface, Doublestrike, 
Underline, and Ribbon/Italic respectively, but you can make them 
anything you like.  "Toggles" are good for features like underline 
and bold that are turned on and off.  "Switches" are better for 
multivalued parameters like character pitch.
     Example: your printer uses ESC-U-01 (and 00) to turn 
underlining on (and off).  If you install these codes with 
ZDENSTAL:
                   ^S toggle on:  (03)1B5501
                     ...and off:  (03)1B5500

then all you have to type in ZDE to get underlined text is: 
^PSunderlined text^PS.

5.16.  Printing (^K-P).

     The ^K-P command PRINTS all or part of the file in memory.  
You will be asked for a set of "Options:", at which point you may 
enter zero or more of the following, in any order:

     B      prints only the currently marked BLOCK.
     P      PAUSES for your keystroke before each page (sheet 
             feed).
     D      DOUBLE SPACES all text to be printed.
     Lnn    sets the printer LEFT MARGIN to nn columns [the 
             default value can be set with ZDENSTAL].
     ^      FILTERS control characters ^X to text "^X".
     *nn    prints the job out nn TIMES (nn=1..255).
     @nn    begins printing AT the nn'th page.
     =nn    renumbers the pages beginning with nn.
     #nn    prints only (up to) a TOTAL of nn pages.
     "..."  uses the quoted string as a HEADER.  The string, 
             followed immediately by the page number, will print 
             at the top right of each page near the margin (maxi-
             mum length is 50 characters; an empty string, "", 
             gives numbered pages with no header text.)

The last four options (@,=,#,"") are NOT allowed if pagination is 
disabled (^O-P), or if "B"lock print was chosen.  Examples:

Options:  L12P
     - Print the file with a left margin of 12 columns, pausing 
       before each page for you to press a key (other than Esc).

Options:  @6#2=14"Instructions, page "
     - Print the sixth and seventh pages of the file, but numbered 
       14 and 15, with the header shown.

Options:  BD^*2
     - Print out the current marked Block twice, double spaced, 
       with control filtering.

     In "W" mode, lines beginning with a "." will be regarded as 
WordStar dot commands, and will neither print out nor affect the 
page count (they have no other effect either).
     You can abort printing at any time with ESC (this may take a 
moment, or a few keystrokes, depending on your BIOS).

5.17.  Ruler Line (^O-T).

     To help you align text properly, ^O-T toggles display of a 
"ruler line" above the text on and off.
     In each column you will see one of several symbols: "[]" 
designate the current margins (if set); "-" indicates areas within 
the current margins, "." outside them.  Also, tab stops are marked 
by either "T" (Variable) or "I" (Hard).  Examples:

("A" mode)      [-----T-----T-----------T--------------]........
("N" mode)      I.......I.......I.......I.......I.......I.......

5.18.  Tabs (^I, ESC-TAB, ^O-V, ^O-I, ^O-N).

     There are two Tab modes: Variable and Hard, and the ^O-V 
command toggles between them.  In Hard Tab mode the Tab key 
produces an actual ^I (ASCII 09); whether this overwrites any 
existing text depends on the Insert toggle.  Hard Tabs display by 
default at fixed intervals of 8 screen columns [this is 
configurable to any multiple of 2].
     In Variable Tab mode, the Tab key moves the cursor to the 
next variable tab stop (you can always get a Hard Tab by typing 
^P-I).  If Insert is on, spaces are inserted up to the next tab 
stop.  Otherwise, existing text is skipped over, but spaces are 
still added at the end of a line as needed.  Up to eight tab stops 
may be set with ^O-I and cleared with ^O-N; the defaults are in 
columns 6, 11, 16, and 21 [these are configurable].  At the 
prompt, enter the column number desired, or hit RETURN for the 
cursor column.
     The ^O-I command also accepts two multiple-set inputs: "@nn" 
sets tab stops every "nn" columns, while "#n1,n2,..." sets tabs at 
columns "n1,n2, ...".  Both remove any pre-existing tabs, and 
typing "@" or "#" alone simply clears all tabs.
     The ESC-TAB command moves backward (left) to the previous 
variable or hard tab stop.

5.19.  Undelete (^U, ^Q-U).

     The undelete functions may be used (repeatedly if necessary) 
to recover a reasonable amount of text deleted either by 
overtyping, or with any of ZDE's delete commands, IF the cursor 
has not yet been moved away.  ^U undeletes one character; ^Q-U 
does a whole line.
     Restrictions: undelete may not recover all of a Block delete 
unless the cursor was in or near the block deleted, and it may 
work imperfectly if DEL has been used several times in sequence.
     Further use after all deleted text is recovered will produce 
junk (usually duplicates of text above the cursor, which is 
sometimes useful).

5.20.  Upper/Lower Case (^^).

     The ^^ (ctl-caret) command changes the case of the character 
at the cursor, if it was a letter, and moves the cursor one 
character to the right.  Useful for capitalizing a string of 
lowercase text, or vice versa.

5.21.  Window and Screen (^W, ^Z, ESC-Arrows, ^O-Up, -W, -Z).

     ZDE supports several functions to move and alter the display 
screen.
     The ^W and ^Z commands scroll the screen up and down a line 
at a time, without moving the cursor (unless necessary).
     Preceded by ESC, any arrow (except ANSI) moves the screen 
rather than the cursor:  the text as a whole shifts up/down 1/4 
screen, or right/left 32 columns, while the cursor stays put (the 
cursor must be past column 32 for horizontal shifts to work).
     Preceded by ^O-, any UP arrow key (except ANSI) makes the 
current text line the top of the screen.
     The ^O-W command creates a WINDOW in the bottom half of the 
screen, which retains a copy of the file text starting at the 
current line, plus the current status and/or ruler line(s), if 
any.  Editing continues normally in the top half of the screen.  
This is useful for comparing different sections of text within a 
file, or even between different files.  Typing ^O-W again removes 
the Window.  Note: Windowing is only supported for screens of 15 
or more lines.
     The ^O-Z command temporarily zaps (blanks) the entire screen; 
good for avoiding CRT burn-in, or just protecting work from prying 
eyes or fingers.  Restore the screen by pressing ESC or SPACE.  
Note: if Windowing was in effect, any text in the window will be 
lost.

5.22.  Wordwrap, Reformat (^B, ^O-D).

     WORDWRAP is automatic in Document ("W" or "A") modes whenever 
the right margin is set.  Any text entered will be formatted to 
the current margin settings as you type.  The end of a paragraph 
is marked by a "HARD CR", which occurs when you press the RETURN 
key (this is a CR immediately following a character of text).  In 
contrast, when wordwrap occurs you get a "SOFT CR" (which is 
actually a CR with a space before it).  You can change a hard CR 
into a soft one, or vice versa, by deleting or adding a space at 
the end of the line.  Hitting RETURN also hardens a soft CR.  The 
distinction between hard and soft CRs is only important when 
reformatting.
     ^B REFORMATS from the line the cursor is on, to the end of 
the paragraph, according to the current margin settings and line 
spacing.  ^B may be used not only to reshape a paragraph after 
editing, but also to change its margins and line spacing.  
Indentation can be tricky if you have a left margin set.  If the 
current line is indented relative to the next one, ZDE assumes 
that amount as your paragraph indentation.
     ^O-D toggles DISPLAY OF HARD CRs.  Hard CRs, otherwise 
invisible, can be caused to display as a "<" character.  This can 
be useful; some may find it distracting, so it turns off.


6.  Macros.

6.1.  Macro (ESC-M).

     A MACRO is a string of ZDE commands and text that, once 
defined, can be repeated automatically.  When you type ESC-M you 
will be asked for the string, then a "Repeat count".  Usually you 
will simply type a number for the repeat count (0-9, or "*" for 
"indefinitely").  You will see the results as the macro executes, 
and you can abort it at any time by pressing ESC.  If you are sure 
you know what you're doing, you can speed up Macro execution by 
specifying "Quiet" mode: press "Q" before the repeat count.  Only 
the header, if present, will be updated as the Macro runs.
     Macros also stop any time an error occurs; the error message 
will be visible, and can be cleared by pressing ESC.  Many 
commands (like Find or Reformat) are designed to generate errors 
at the end of the file so that indefinite ("*") Macros containing 
them halt there.  You may need to abort other indefinite Macros 
manually.
     ZDE turns INSERT OFF before running a macro, so that the same 
key sequence will always have the same effect.  INSERT status is 
restored when the macro terminates.
     In order to include any input line editing characters (BS, 
CR, etc.) in a macro, you must prefix them with ^P.  (NOTE:  To 
make them easier to read and understand, Macro listings are given 
here as they function, not as they are typed in.  ^P prefixes as 
needed are NOT shown.  Keystrokes are separated by dashes or 
commas for clarity, and "_" means a space or blank.) Here are some 
sample Macros:

     1.  View a file by scrolling slowly through it:

               ESC-;, ^C

         This will pause, then scroll down.  (Use a repeat count 
          of "*".)
     
     2.  Can you figure out what this one does?  

       ^QR, ^QF, (, CR, ^G, ^KB, ^QF, ), CR, ^G, ^KK, ^QC, CR, ^KV

         (Answer:  .elif eht fo dne eht ta meht fo tsil a gnikam 
         elif a fo tuo sesehtnerap ni stnemmoc ekat lliw tI)

     ZDE Macros are very powerful tools, particularly given their 
programmability and storage on function keys.

6.2.  Macro Key (ESC-#, ESC-0..9).

     Up to 10 MACRO KEYS can be stored (0..9), by entering them 
with the ESC-M command, then using ESC-# to save them.  They can 
then be recalled and used simply by typing ESC-number.  Example: 
typing ESC-#-0 will store the last Macro used in the ESC-0 command 
so that it can be recalled and reused at any future time simply by 
typing ESC-0.
     Ordinarily, Macro Keys operate just like the original Macro, 
asking for a "Repeat count" when executed.  If you want to 
suppress this prompt (resulting in a "function key" that executes 
just once) you can type "N" (for No repeat) before storing the key 
number.  Example:  ESC-#-N-0 makes ESC-0 a no-repeat macro key.  
If you also don't need to see the Macro work, and want to make it 
faster, you can make it QUIET as well by typing "Q" instead (for 
Quiet) before the key number.  Example: ESC-#-Q-0 stores ESC-0 as 
a quiet no-repeat key sequence.
     If the Macro (ESC-M) string is empty, using ESC-# will delete 
a Macro Key.  Using a defined Key makes it the last macro used, so 
it can be stored again in another key if desired.  Trying to use 
an undefined Macro Key results in an error.
     There are 500 bytes total available for all 10 keys, and a 
128 byte limit for any one Key (ZDE's own input line will only 
accept 65 bytes, but ZDENSTAL can handle up to the full 128.)
     USAGE HINT: If you want to re-use a macro without having to 
type it in again, use ESC-# to assign it to a key, then call it up 
by number.
     Besides simply storing Macros, here are some useful Macro 
Keys:

     1.  Storing different sets of margins (e.g., for quotes).  
     For example,
               ^OL, 12, CR, ^OR, 66, CR

     2.  Typing any frequently repeated phrase; "ESC-6" is much 
     more convenient than "^PSWorld Wide Widgets Ltd. (N.A.)^PS".

     3.  Swap the two characters preceding the cursor:
               ^S, ^S, ^G, ^D, ^U, ^U, ^D, ^G

[ZDENSTAL allows you to install defaults for all ten Macro Keys.  
Thus a copy of ZDE can be customized for any task, such as the 
formatting requirements of specialized writing or programming 
languages.]

6.3.  Macro Programming (ESC-0..9, ESC-!,=,~,+,;).

     ZDE has several commands which function only in a Macro 
string, and give you control over the execution of a macro, 
allowing true programming.
     ESC-0..9 function as LABELS 0..9 when entered as part of a 
Macro.  They have no effect, but can be "jumped" to by other 
commands.
     ESC-! followed by 0..9 is a JUMP instruction, and causes 
macro execution to resume with the command following the label 
ESC-0..9.  Example: ESC!2 jumps to label 2.  As two special cases, 
ESC-![ jumps to the beginning of the Macro, and ESC-!] jumps to 
the end (aborts).
     ESC-= and ESC-~, followed by a character and then a label 
0..9 (or "[","]"), are CONDITIONAL JUMPS: they jump to the label 
or the start or end of the macro IF the character at the cursor 
position matches (ESC-=) or doesn't match (ESC-~) the character 
specified.  Example: ESC~^M2 jumps to ESC-2 if the current 
character is NOT a CR.
     ESC-= and ESC-~, followed by a character and then ">" or "<", 
are SEARCH LOOPS.  They will continue to move the cursor right 
(">") or left ("<") AS LONG AS the character at the cursor matches 
(ESC-=) or doesn't match (ESC-~) the specified character.  Both 
search loops terminate automatically at the beginning or end of 
the file.  Example: ESC=_> moves right as long as the current 
character is a space.
     ESC-+, followed by 0..9, CHAINS to another macro key, 
allowing you to build macros strings longer than the storage limit 
of any one key.  It does not "call" the key; there is no 
returning.  Example: ESC+9 chains to Key 9.
     ESC-; (semicolon) gives a brief pause, presumably so the user 
can see what's happening on screen.
     Macro programs are stored just like any other macro string 
(usually with "N"o repeat count).  If you program in an endless 
loop, you will at some point have to abort with ESC.  Don't make 
macro programs "Q"uiet until you're sure they work.
     Example: here is a good macro program (best stored as a Quiet 
Key) to move the cursor to the start of the current sentence:

       ESC~.1, ^S, ESC1, ESC~.<, ESC2, ^D, ESC=_2, ESC=^M2

You could write this out in programmer's pseudo-code as:

         If not "." goto label1
         Move left                 ;move left if already on period
label1:  While not "." move Left   ;move left to previous period
label2:  Move right                ;now move back right
         If " " goto label2        ;  as long as you see a space
         If "^M" goto label2       ;  or a Return
         (all done)


7.  General Information.

7.1.  Disk Space.

     ZDE isn't disk-bound; if you run out of disk space, just 
insert another disk (always keep a blank FORMATTED disk around).  
Alternatively, you can use the ESC-F and ESC-E commands to purge 
unneeded files.  [If you have small disks, you can also install 
ZDE not to preserve BAK files.]
     Let ZDE's filesize limits encourage you to break work up into 
files of 50K or less; larger files make inefficient use of floppy 
disks.

7.2.  Error Messages.

     Press ESC or Space to continue.  "Error" alone means the 
command used just won't work in this situation.  (Example: a block 
command was used with no block marked.)  More specific errors are:

  "Out of Memory" - the file, block, or key string won't fit in 
                     RAM.
    "Invalid Key" - an illegal command key sequence was pressed.
      "I/O Error" - file not found, disk full, empty/invalid 
                     drive, etc.
"Cannot Reformat" - word too long, or margins invalid.
      "Not Found" - the object of a search was not found.
   "Syntax Error" - a macro programming command was misused.

7.3.  File Modes.

     ZDE has three FILE MODES: "W"ordStar document, "A"SCII 
document, and "N"on-document.  The basic difference concerns the 
format of disk files.
     In "W" mode, ZDE reads and writes WordStar-compatible files.  
ZDE can edit a WordStar document, except that any right 
justification will be lost.  WordStar can edit any ZDE "W" file in 
Document mode.
     In "A" or "N" mode, ZDE reads and writes text as standard 
ASCII 7-bit characters, a universal format accepted by virtually 
all software.  The only difference between "A" and "N" modes lies 
in the default settings on loading a new file.  Typically "A" mode 
is used for word processing, and "N" mode for programming and 
other technical applications.

DEFAULTS FOR:                Margins      Tabs       Hard CR disp.
------------                 -------      ----       ------------   
"A"SCII or "W"ordStar mode   ACTIVE       VARIABLE   [ON]
"N"on-document               DISABLED     HARD       OFF

     The file mode option can be specified along with the filename 
at any ZDE file function prompt, allowing you to mix WordStar and 
ASCII disk files as needed (see Invoking ZDE, above).  You can 
also change the current mode with the ^K-N function by entering a 
new mode (e.g., "[W") with or without a filename.
     [ZDENSTAL allows you to select a default file mode, to be 
used when no mode is specified (originally this is "A").  Further, 
you can specify two filetype masks for automatic mode selection 
(e.g., all "ASM" files as "N" mode) to override that default.]
     NOTE ON ASCII FILES - The "A"SCII-document file format used 
since VDE 2.50, to allow accurate formatting and WordStar 
compatibility, distinguishes between HARD and SOFT CRs (see 
Wordwrap, above).  Consequently, if you edit an ASCII file created 
by other software (including earlier versions of VDE), it may 
appear to be full of hard CRs, making text impossible to reformat. 
There are two easy ways to solve this problem: first, you can use 
^Q-A to find "^M"s and selectively replace them with " ^M".  
Alternatively, the following Macro (best stored as a Quiet macro 
Key) does a good job of "softening up" paragraphs for reformatting:

               ^QS,^X,ESC=_],ESC=CR],^S,^V_^V,^D,ESC![

7.4.  Hyphenation (^O-H).

     ZDE can't introduce hyphens, but it does recognize them in 
the text, treating them as a legitimate place to break a line, so 
if you have a long word close to the margin, you can insert a 
hyphen where you'd like the word to be broken.
     Similarly, ZDE can't unhyphenate.  If it is trying to 
reformat and finds a hyphen at the end of a line, it will pause to 
ask you what to do with it.  You will see the prompt "Chg?" in the 
header, and can:
     Press "Y" to remove the hyphen and space, joining the word;
           "N" to leave the hyphen, but still join the word;
           "ESC" to leave both the hyphen and the space alone.
Typically you would choose "Y" for "soft" hyphens that you 
introduced to break up a word ("intro-duction"); "N" for hard 
hyphens that are part of a word ("vis-a-vis"); and "ESC" for 
punctuation (dashes "--", etc.).  After your choice, reformatting 
will proceed automatically.
     You can toggle hyphenation on and off with ^O-H.  If off, 
hyphens are not treated differently from any other text character. 
[The ^O-H default can be changed with ZDENSTAL.]

7.5.  Interruption.

     If ZDE is interrupted by messages from other software (BIOS 
error, resident utilities, etc.), it may lose control of the 
screen.  The best way to return it to normal is by blanking and 
restoring the screen (^O-Z, ESC).

7.6.  Prompts.

     First, ZDE has several simple prompts requiring you to 
confirm an action by typing "Y" or "N":

       "Abandon changes?" - warns the file you want to Quit has 
                             been changed.
"Unchanged; save anyway?" - reminds the file you want saved isn't 
                             changed.
       "Delete original?" - do you want to delete block copied 
                             from 2nd file?
                   "Chg?" - do you want to change this instance of 
                             a string?

Then, there are a few special purpose prompts:

          "Repeat count:" - enter (optional "Q" and) repeat count 
                             for Macro.
            "Key number:" - enter (optional "N/Q" and) key number 
                             for Key.
                    "Rdy" - press any key to print next page (ESC 
                             quits).

Finally, there are a variety of prompts for either numeric or 
string input, like "Column:" or "Find string:".  You are expected 
to type in a string (up to 65 characters).  The following control 
keys operate:

         Correct mistake:     BS (^H), ^S, or Del
         Erase entire entry:  ^X
         Abort operation:     ^U

Note that to get any of these codes, or a CR, into the string 
itself, you must precede it with ^P (this includes ^P).  Examples: 
to find a line beginning with a "*" (find "^M,*") type

               ^Q-F, ^P-CR, *, CR.

Now to get this into a Macro with ESC-M, you would have to type

               ESC-M, ^Q-F, ^P-P, ^P-CR, *, ^P-CR, CR.

7.7.  WordStar Compatibility.

     In most respects ZDE operates much like WordStar; one big 
difference is the absence of a "No-File" menu.  You are always in 
edit mode; use ^K-L to select a new file to edit.
     If the keys ^J, ^K, ^L are in use as CP/M arrow keys, you 
must use ZDE's original command set to substitute for them as 
follows:

                    Block prefix (^K-)... ESC-
                    Help menu (^J)....... ESC-H
                    Repeat find (^L)..... ^\

     If these keys are NOT installed as arrow keys, they retain 
their WordStar functions.  Then, of course, ZDE lacks some 
WordStar commands, and has some of its own.  Aside from these, 
there are the following differences in common commands:

COMMON USE         WORDSTAR 4    ZDE    ZDE NOTES
Hide block         ^K-H         ^K-U    Actually unmarks block.
Erase disk file    ^K-J         ^K-E
Set Place Mark     ^K-0..9      ^P-Z    Not individually numbered.
Go to Place Mark   ^Q-0..9      ^Q-P    Cyclic.

COMMON COMMAND     WORDSTAR 4 USE        ZDE USE
      ^^           Soften hard CR        Transpose upper/lowercase
      ^K-N         Column block mode     Rename current work
      ^O-D         Display ^P codes      Display hard CRs
      ^O-F         Ruler from text       Flush right
      ^O-P         Preview mode          Page length
      ^Q-U         Repeat align          Repeat undelete

Note that ZDE does not implement WordStar "dot commands" in text, 
though in "W" mode it avoids printing them.
