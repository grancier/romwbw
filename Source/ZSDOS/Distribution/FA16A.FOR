An update and bug-fix of FILEATTR (FA), a ZSDOS utility that 
allows rapid setting, resetting, or displaying of file attributes 
under ZSDOS, ZRDOS, and CP/M 2.2.  Several additional features 
are available under ZCPR3, including error flag setting, error 
handler invocation, and an enhanced display.  Version 1.6A adds 
documentation; otherwise, same as 1.6.
