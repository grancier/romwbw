This directory contains the source and assembled versions of the ZSystem Clock Drivers for N8VEM HBIOS.

The hbclk.z80 source file can be compiled using Build.cmd which will produce a relocatable binary (hbclk.rel).

The relocatable binary should be added/updated in the stamps.dat libary.  The stamps.dat file is just a standard LU type library and is easily updated using NULU.  The members are the relocatable binaries, but with the .REL extension removed.

SETUPZST is used to create runnable executable (.COM) files.  An executable has been created for DateStamper (LDDS.COM) and P2DOS (LDP2D.COM).  The executables are all configured for operation as an RSX (resident system extension).

The STAMPS.DAT file here is a version that I cobbled together.  Using the STAMPS.DAT file included in the ZSDOS distribution results in a load file that does not work.  It claims to load, but is not present.  I found a "fixed" version of STAMPS.DAT on the Walnut Creek CD-ROM which works, but was missing the NZ and NZP2 stamp variants.  So, I added those variants to the working version of STAMPS.DAT which is included here.
