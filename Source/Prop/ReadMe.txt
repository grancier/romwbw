This directory contains the files used to build the EEPROM firmware 
images for the Propeller based boards supported by RomWBW.

The build process places the resulting ROM image files in the Binary 
directory.  The firmware images are intended to integrate with a host 
CPU board running RomWBW.  The following images are created:

 - PropIO.eeprom for use with original PropIO
 - PropIO2.eeprom for use with PropIO V2
 - ParPortProp.eeprom for use with Zeta ParPortProp
